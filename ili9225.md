# Display Overview and Terminology

The ILI9225 is a 176 × 220 pixel color display with 6 bits per color channel
(RGB). In this document (as well as the datasheet) the display is assumed to be
in portrait mode with the flat flex connector side considered the bottom side.

The pixels are contously updated (scanned) from the contents of the graphics RAM
(GRAM). The GRAM consists of 18-bit words, one for each of the 172 × 220 pixels,
which in total are 696,960 bits. This equals 87,120 bytes, but note that the
GRAM is not byte-oriented. Each location in the GRAM is identified by a 16-bit
address conisting of a _row address_ (the high 8 bits) and a _column address_
(the low 8 bits): 0xRRCC. Valid addresses have 0x00 ≤ RR ≤ 0xDB and 0x00 ≤ CC ≤
0xAF. Note that the GRAM address space contains "holes" between each row of
pixels.

GRAM addresses are not mapped fixedly to physical pixels. The mapping can be
configured to use mirroring and scrolling (see Driver Output Control). In
addition, transfers into GRAM can be done in any order (row/column major) and
any direction, which allows mirroring and also transposing to be performed while
the data while transferred (see Entry Mode).

    horizontal address: 0x__00 - 0x__AF <-> source: S1-S528 (3×RGB) <-> physical column: left - right
      vertical address: 0x00__ - 0xDB__ <->   gate: G1-G220         <->    physical row: top - bottom

When accessing data in the GRAM an address counter (AC) keeps track of the
current location in GRAM. The AC is only when manipulating the GRAM through the
interface and is not used by the automatic internal scan process. The AC can be
assigned to specific values and is automatically updated (incremented or
decremented and wrapped) after each write.

When data is written to the GRAM using 16-bit color values (as with the 4-wire
8-bit serial interface), the colors are encoded in the RGB565 scheme:
0bRRRRRGGGGGGBBBBB. More color formats are supported.

## 0x00 Chip ID Code

`-, -, -, -,   -, -, -, -,   ID7, ID6, ID5, ID4,   ID3, ID2, ID1, ID0`

## 0x01 Driver Output Control

`VSPL, HSPL, DPL, EPL,   0, SM, GS, SS,   0, 0, 0, NL4,   NL3, NL2, NL1, NL0`

GS and SS can be said to control in which corner the 0x0000 GRAM adress is
located (assuming no scrolling). The values are:

* **GS=0, SS=0:** top-right
* **GS=0, SS=1:** top-left
* **GS=1, SS=0:** bottom-right
* **GS=1, SS=1:** bottom-left

* **SM:** This controls whether even and odd gates should be together or in
  separate halves of the display. If SM is 0, then the top row is G1, the next
  one is G2, and the bottom row is G220. If SM is 1, then the top half of the
  display consists of odd gates (G1, G3, ..., G119) and the bottom half of the
  display conists of the even gates (G2, G4, ..., G220). Changing this bit
  causes existing GRAM rows to _immediately_ appear at new physical locations on
  the screen.
* **GS:** gate shift direction. This controls the mapping between row addresses
  and physical rows / gates. When GS is 0, low row addresses correspond to top
  and high to bottom. When GS is 1, low row addresses correspond to bottom and
  high to top. Changing this bit causes existing GRAM pixels to _immediately_ be
  displayed mirrored.
* **SS:** source (column) shift direction. This contols the mapping between
  column addresses and physical columns / sources. When SS is 0, low column
  addresses correspond to right and high to left. When SS is 1, low column
  addresses correspond to left and low to right. Changing this bit _does not_
  cause any immediate change in the displayed image, but affects future writes
  to the GRAM.
* **NL4 - NL0:** number of active gate drivers. This controls which gates should
  be driven. Only the first n = NL*8 gates are driven: G1 to Gn. Undriven rows
  become white. If SM is 0, then this means only the n topmost rows are drivern.
  If SM is 1 this means that only the n first odd rows are driven (if n ≤ 110)
  or that all odd rows and only the n-110 first odd rows are driven (if n >
  110). Changing this bit takes effect immediately.

## 0x02 LCD Driving Waveform Control

`0, 0, 0, 0,   0, 0, INV1, INV0,   0, 0, 0, 0,   0, 0, 0, FLD`

No visible effect to the naked eye. Don't know what these do.

## 0x03 Entry Mode

`0, 0, 0, BGR,   0, 0, MDT1, MDT0,   0, 0, I/D1, I/D0,   AM, 0, 0, 0`

This register controls how data is transferred between the system interface (for
example the 4-wire 8-bit serial interface) and the GRAM. Data is written
sequentially, starting from the address stored in AC. After each write the AC is
advanced to the next position and after many writes it will eventuallty end up
back at the starting point. It also is possible to limit the transfers to only
happen withing a specified GRAM window.

The BGR, MDT1, and MDT0 bits together determine the pixel format used in
transfers.

The I/D1, I/D0, and AM registers together determine what the next AC position is
becomes after a write. In other words, they determine the sequence in which all
GRAM locations are walked through during writes. AM determines if the order is
row major (AM=0) or column major (AM=1). I/D1 determines if vertical AC movement
means increasing the row address (I/D1=1) or decreasing it (I/D1=0). Likewise,
I/D0 determines if horizontal AC movement means increasing the column address
(I/D0=1) or decreasing it (I/D0=0).

When writing the the pixel sequence a, b, ... l to a 4×3 GRAM area with
addresses 0x1020 to 0x1322, the address sequence looks like this (assuming the
AC register was set to the "a" position initially):

    AM=0, I/D1=1, I/D0=1           AM=0, I/D=1, I/D0=0

* **BGR:** swap red and blue color channels when writing to GRAM. This seems to
  be there to so that this chip can be used for both displays with RGB and BGR
  subpixel order. Changing this bit _does not_ cause any immediate change in the
  displayed image, but affects future writes to the GRAM.
* **MDT1, MDT0:** data transfer mode. When using SPI, MDT1=0 MDT0=0 means that
  each 16-bit data transfer contains one pixel using the "65k color" RGB565 or
  BGR565 schemes (which one depends on the BGR bit value).
* **I/D1:** increment or decrement row addresses. See description above.
* **I/D0:** increment or decrement column addresses. See description above.
* **AM:** row major or column major order. See description above.

## 0x07 Display Control 1

`0, 0, 0, TEMON,   0, 0, 0, 0,   0, 0, 0, GON,   CL, REV, D1, D0`

GON, D1, and D0 are all set in normal operation.

* **TEMON:** FLM pin enabled. This bit enables a pulse on the FLM pin on each
  frame. Can be used to syncrhonize writes to avoid tearing.
* **GON:** don't know what this does.
* **CL:** 8 color mode. When active, the color depth is reduced two 1 bit per
  channel, resulting in 8 possible colors. The GRAM data remains 6 bits per
  channels, but only the MSB is used by the display. This is described as a
  power saving feature in the datasheet.
* **REV:** invert displayed colors. Changing this bit causes existing GRAM
  pixels to _immediately_ be displayed invertedly.
* **D1, D0:** don't know what these do.
